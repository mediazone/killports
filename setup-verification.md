## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Copy Workflow to Private Repo
```bash
# Copy the workflow file to your private repo:
cp .github/workflows/build-and-release.yml /path/to/KillPortsMenuBar/.github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to: `https://github.com/mediazone/KillPortsMenuBar/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these 7 secrets:
- [ ] `CERTIFICATES_P12` (Base64 Developer ID Application cert)
- [ ] `CERTIFICATES_P12_PASSWORD` (Certificate password)
- [ ] `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (Your Apple Developer Team ID)
- [ ] `NOTARIZATION_USERNAME` (Apple ID email)
- [ ] `NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD` (App-specific password)
- [ ] `PUBLIC_REPO_TOKEN` (GitHub PAT with repo access)
- [ ] `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` (Base64 provisioning profile)

### Step 3: Test Manual Workflow
1. Go to private repo Actions
2. Run "Build and Release KillPorts" manually
3. Use version: `v1.0.1-test`
4. Verify release appears in public repo

### Step 4: Test Tag-based Release
```bash
cd /path/to/KillPortsMenuBar
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

### Step 5: Verify Website Auto-Update
1. Visit killports.com
2. Open browser console
3. Check for API calls to GitHub
4. Verify button shows latest version

## üîß Expected Workflow

### Current State:
```
Private Repo: KillPortsMenuBar (your Swift code)
Public Repo:  killports (v1.0.0 release)
Website:      killports.com (shows v1.0.0)
```

### After Setup:
```
1. Commit to private repo
2. GitHub Actions builds & signs app
3. Creates release in public repo  
4. Website auto-detects new version
5. Users get latest signed .pkg
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] **Manual workflow runs** and creates release
- [ ] **Tag-based workflow** triggers automatically  
- [ ] **Public repo** gets new release with .pkg file
- [ ] **Website** displays new version immediately
- [ ] **Download link** points to correct .pkg file
- [ ] **App is signed** and notarized by Apple

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Verification

- [x] **No API keys in public repo**
- [x] **GitHub secrets configured in private repo only**
- [x] **Website uses public GitHub API**
- [x] **CORS enabled for browser requests**
- [x] **All sensitive data in private repository**

## üìä Monitoring

After setup, you can monitor:

1. **GitHub Actions** in private repo for build status
2. **Public releases** at `https://github.com/mediazone/killports/releases`
3. **Website API calls** in browser developer tools
4. **Download analytics** through GitHub release download counts

## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Check

If something doesn't work:

```bash
# Test API manually
curl https://api.github.com/repos/mediazone/killports/releases/latest

# Test website JavaScript  
node test-release-api.js

# Check build logs
# Go to private repo ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí View failed workflow
```

## üéâ Final Result

After successful setup:

1. **Zero manual work** for releases
2. **Automatic version detection** on website  
3. **Always current download links**
4. **Apple-signed, notarized releases**
5. **Professional release notes**
6. **Complete automation** from code to user

**Your release process**: `git tag v1.0.2 && git push origin v1.0.2` ‚ú®
